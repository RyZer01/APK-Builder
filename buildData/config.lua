gameName = "Butterfly game!"
packageName = "com.cooldevelopers.butterfly.yay" --See https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-determine-the-package-name-of-an-android-app/
versionCode = "1"
versionSemantic = "1.0"
usesMicrophone = true

--[[
Here are what the variables mean. You just have to change their values:
 packageName is your game internal package name.
 versionCode is the internal APK version code.
 versionSemantic is the readable APK version string. Example: 2.1.0
 gameName is your game name which is going to be displayed in home screen/launcher.
 Set usesMicrophone to true if your program needs it

You can do a google search about any of these if feeling confused
